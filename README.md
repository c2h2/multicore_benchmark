# multicore_benchmark 
Simple math arithmetics, Parallelly benchmarking core performace with GO

When number of thread(goroutine)s > number of physical cores, the total calculation time will be linearly increased.ðŸ¤£ as total work is shared among cores.

When number of thread(goroutine)s <= number of physical cores, the total calculation time will be not much affected. ðŸ˜€

# Build: on mac/linux
```go build multicore_bench.go``` or ```./build_all_platforms.sh ```

# Run: with 4 cores
```./multicore_bench -c 4```
 
# Running results:
Macbook Air M1 (4PC + 4EC)
